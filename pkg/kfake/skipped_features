# Skipped Features
#
# This file tracks features that were intentionally skipped during the
# kfake feature gap analysis. These can be revisited in future sessions.

* Add support for instance IDs for consumer groups, and support KIP-814 https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-814%3A+Static+membership+protocol+should+let+the+leader+skip+assignment

## 00_produce
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request
- Compaction: Log compaction not supported
- ErrorRecords (v8+): Per-record errors not implemented; kfake validates at batch level only
- TimeoutMillis: Ignored since writes are immediate (no replication)

## 02_list_offsets
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request
- Timestamp -4: Local log start offset not implemented - tiered storage (KIP-405)

## 08_offset_commit
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request
- InstanceID (v7+): Returns error if set - static membership not implemented

## 09_offset_fetch
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request
- MemberID/MemberEpoch (v9+): KIP-848 member epoch validation not implemented in
  standard OffsetFetch handler; consumer group offset commits go through the
  heartbeat-based path in groups.go instead

## 10_find_coordinator
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request
- Share groups (coordinator type 2): Not implemented (KIP-932)

## 11_join_group, 12_heartbeat, 13_leave_group, 14_sync_group
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request
- InstanceID/static membership: Not fully implemented (KIP-345)
- SkipAssignment: Not implemented (KIP-814)
- Initial rebalance delay: Skipped - optimization for reducing rebalance churn
  during rolling restarts, not needed for correctness in tests
- Group max size: Not enforced - low value for testing

## 21_delete_records
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request
- TimeoutMillis: Ignored since writes are immediate

## 22_init_producer_id
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request
- prevProducerId/lastProducerEpoch: Only matters for epoch exhaustion at 32K+
  transactions per transactional ID, which never happens in tests
- Transactional ID expiration: Background cleanup for idle transactional IDs;
  tests are short-lived so expiration never matters
- CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS error: Impossible in kfake's synchronous model

## 23_offset_for_leader_epoch

## 33_alter_configs
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request

- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request
- ErrorCode (v3+): Top-level error code not implemented
- OffsetLag: Always returns 0 (no replication delay tracking)
- IsFuture: Always returns false (no async replica moves)

## 36_sasl_authenticate
- SessionLifetimeMillis (v1+): Session re-auth not implemented

## 37_create_partitions
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request
- TimeoutMillis: Ignored since writes are immediate

## 38-41 Delegation Tokens
- Not implemented: CreateDelegationToken, RenewDelegationToken, ExpireDelegationToken, DescribeDelegationToken
- Reason: Adds complexity for marginal testing value; no kgo APIs use these directly

## 42_delete_groups
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request

## 44_incremental_alter_configs
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request
- APPEND/SUBTRACT ops: List config operations not implemented

## 50_describe_user_scram_credentials
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request

## 51_alter_user_scram_credentials
- ThrottleMillis: Not implementing throttling for any request

## 68_consumer_group_heartbeat (KIP-848) - IMPLEMENTED
- Basic handler implemented: server-side uniform and range assignment, member
  epoch tracking, session timeouts, regex subscription, leave (epoch -1)
- SubscribedTopicRegex: supported (RE2 syntax, not Java RE2J)
- Remaining static membership gaps:
  - kfake: support MemberEpoch -2 (leave with instance ID retained)
  - kfake: fence by instance ID, not just member ID
  - kfake: on session timeout, do not remove static member (keep assignment reserved)
  - kfake: on rejoin with same instance ID, restore previous assignment
  - kfake: range assignor should sort static members (by instance ID) before dynamic
    members (by member ID)
  - See KIP-345, KIP-814 for the classic group static member protocol
- Metadata hash / metadata expiration: deliberate divergence; kfake recomputes
  assignments on every relevant heartbeat rather than caching a metadata hash

### Correctness gaps vs Kafka (analyzed against ~/src/apache/kafka):

1. **No partition epoch tracking** - FIXED (63e50a66)
   Added group-level partitionEpochs map with two-phase check
   in reconciledAssignment.

2. **Member epoch advancement only when fully converged** - SKIPPED
   kfake's conservative approach (not advancing until fully converged) is
   safe and simpler. Advancing in UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS state
   only affects convergence speed, not correctness.

3. **Previous-epoch subset check against targetAssignment** - FIXED (63e50a66)
   Now checks against currentAssignment.

4. **No separate session/rebalance timeout** - FIXED (b52529f1)
   Session timeout uses group.consumer.session.timeout.ms (server config).
   Rebalance timeout uses per-member rebalanceTimeoutMs, only active when
   member has unrevoked partitions.

5. **No partitionsPendingRevocation tracking** - FIXED (ac7d0fb8)
   Added explicit per-member partitionsPendingRevocation set with
   epoch map integration.

6. **No ASSIGNING/UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS states** (LOW)
   kfake uses empty/reconciling/stable. Missing intermediate states.
   Doesn't affect kgo client behavior.

## 69_consumer_group_describe (KIP-848) - IMPLEMENTED
- Basic handler implemented: returns group state, members, assignments
- AuthorizedOperations: not implemented (always returns 0)

## General
- Tiered storage: Not implemented (KIP-405, KIP-1005)
- Share groups: Not implemented (KIP-932)
- Static membership: InstanceID handling not fully implemented (KIP-345)
