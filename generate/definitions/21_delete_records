// DeleteRecordsRequest is an admin request to delete records from Kafka.
// This was added for KIP-107.
//
// To delete records, Kafka sets the LastStableOffset for partitions to
// the requested offset. All segments whose max partition is before the
// requested offset are deleted, and any records within the segment before
// the requested offset can no longer be read.
//
// This request must be issued to the correct brokers that own the partitions
// you intend to delete records for.
DeleteRecordsRequest => key 21, max version 2, flexible v2+
  // Topics contains topics for which to delete records from.
  Topics: [=>]
    // Topic is a topic to delete records from.
    Topic: string
    // Partitions contains partitions to delete records from.

      // Offset is the offset to set the partition's low watermark (start
      // offset) to. After a successful response, all records before this
      // offset are considered deleted and are no longer readable.
      //
      // To delete all records, use -1, which is mapped to the partition's
      // current high watermark.
